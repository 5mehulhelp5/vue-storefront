Vue Storefront provides out-of-the-box integrations for various third-party solutions (you can find them listed [here](https://docs.vuestorefront.io/v2/integrations/)). However, sometimes your project might need to connect to a service that Vue Storefront does not integrate with by default.

For this case, you can leverage our default pattern to create your own integration easily and keep your project coherent!

This quick tutorial will guide you step-by-step through creating a simple integration with [JSON Placeholder Free Fake API.](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)

## Locating custom integration code

Integrations delivered by Vue Storefront are installed in your project as dependencies. When it comes to creating your own integrations, the easiest solution would be to create a dedicated `/integrations` directory in the root of your project.

To kick off working with this tutorial, please, add the following directory structure to the root of your project (highlighted in blue):

## Creating custom integration module

The `nuxt` folder of your custom integration will contain its entry logic. This has two parts:

- a **plugin** injecting your integration's API methods into the global application context
- a **module** responsible for registering the plugin

Let's start with adding a simple `plugin.js` file:

```jsx
// integrations/jsonplaceholder/nuxt/plugin.js

import { integrationPlugin } from '@vue-storefront/core';

export default integrationPlugin(({ integration }) => {
  integration.configure('jsonplaceholder', { ...<%= serialize(options) %>})
});

```

Next, add an `index.js` file for your module:

```jsx
// integrations/jsonplaceholder/nuxt/index.js

import * as path from 'path';

export default function jsonplaceholder(moduleOptions) {
  this.addPlugin({
    src: path.resolve(__dirname, 'plugin.js'),
    options: moduleOptions,
  });
}
```

You're done with the `/nuxt` directory. At this point, your integration is an empty shell and delivers no functionality, but you can register it in your project already!

## Registering custom integration

Every integration has to be registered in both `nuxt.config.js` and `middleware.config.js`.

First, register your newly-created module in `nuxt.config.js`:

```jsx
// nuxt.config.js

export default {
  buildModules: ['~/integrations/jsonplaceholder/nuxt'],
};
```

::: tip Why `buildModules` and not `modules`?

In this example, you've created a very simple module responsible only for registering your integration's plugin. It does it during the application build, therefore its code does not need to be included in the final bundle.

However, your integration's module could do way more that that. Visit the official Nuxt [documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/modules/) to explore all capabilities of Nuxt modules and the difference between `modules` and `buildModules`.
:::

Secondly, add your integration's configuration in `middleware.config.js`:

```jsx
// middleware.config.js

const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  integrations: {
    jsonplaceholder: {
      location: path.resolve(
        __dirname,
        'integrations/jsonplaceholder/src/index.server.js'
      ),
      configuration: {
        baseURL: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/',
        // apiKey: '1234'
      },
    },
  },
};
```

In this example, the configuration will only contain `baseURL`. However, if your integration requires passing some sensitive credentials (like tokens or API keys), this is the right place to put them.

You might be wondering about the `location` part of the above configuration, and you are right - it refrences a file that does not exist yet. Do not worry. You're going to create it in the next step.

## Creating an API client

Your integration will need an API client to communicate with the 3rd party. For most services, you would use a client provided by their SDKs. This is what Vue Storefront does for the majority of our integrations (e.g. [Contentstack](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/javascript-browser/api-reference/)).

For [JSON Placeholder Free Fake API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), we're simply going to create a dedicated [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) instance. Letâ€™s start with adding the missing `index.server.js` file in `/integrations/jsonplaceholder/src`.

```jsx
// integrations/jsonplaceholder/src/index.server.js

const { apiClientFactory } = require('@vue-storefront/core');
const api = require('./api');
const axios = require('axios');

const setup = (settings) => {
  const { baseURL } = settings;

  const client = axios.create({ baseURL });

  return {
    config: {
      ...settings,
    },
    client,
  };
};

const { createApiClient } = apiClientFactory({
  onCreate: setup,
  api,
});

module.exports = { createApiClient };
```

The `setup` function is crucial here because this is where we create our `axios` client. It receives `baseURL` we had specified in `middleware.config.js` and will be used by API methods located in `/integrations/jsonplaceholder/src/api.js`. Let's create the file as the next step of this tutorial.

## Creating API methods

Your integration with [JSON Placeholder Free Fake API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) will consist of a single `searchTodos` API method responsible for fetching [todos](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos). Create the `/integrations/jsonplaceholder/src/api.js` and add the method code there:

```jsx
// integrations/jsonplaceholder/src/api.js

const { Logger } = require('@vue-storefront/core');

module.exports.searchTodos = async (context, params) => {
  const { client } = context;
  let url = 'todos';

  if (params.id) {
    url += `/${params.id}`;
  }

  try {
    const response = await client.get(url);
    return Array.isArray(response.data) ? response.data : [response.data];
  } catch (err) {
    Logger.error('[jsonplaceholder] searchTodos failed.', error);
  }
};
```

As you can see, your `searchTodos` method receives 2 arguments:

1. an automatically injected `context` containing our API client created in the previous step
2. `params` object which can contain `id`. If it does, the API method will fetch a particular todo entry. If it does not - it will fetch all todos from the database.

The API method will use the previously created client to call the API and either return the received array of todos or Log the error if it occurs. You should now be able to retrieve it from the global application context and use it in your Vue components!

```vue
<template>
  <ul>
    <li v-for="todo in todos" :key="todo.id">
      <span>Title: {{ todo.title }}</span>
      <input type="checkbox" :checked="todo.completed" />
    </li>
  </ul>
</template>

<script>
import { useVSFContext, sharedRef, onSSR } from '@vue-storefront/core';

export default {
  setup() {
    const id = 1;
    const { $jsonplaceholder } = useVSFContext();
    const todos = sharedRef([], `todo-${id}`);

    onSSR(async () => {
      todos.value = await $jsonplaceholder.api.searchTodos({ id });
    });

    return {
      todos,
    };
  },
};
</script>
```

::: tip ðŸ’¡ What is sharedRef?

[sharedRef](https://docs.vuestorefront.io/v2/reference/api/core.sharedref_1.html) is an internal helper which leverages Vue's [ref](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core.html#ref) under the hood to create a new reactive property and persist its value fetched on the server side using the `onSSR` hook.

If you're not using `onSSR` and fetch your data on the client side, you can stick with the default [reactivity API](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core.html) methods provided by `@nuxtjs/composition-api` package.
:::

That might be enough for you already. However, there is one more layer you can add: the composables.

## Creating composable methods

[Composables](https://docs.vuestorefront.io/v2/composition/composables.html) in Vue Storefront:

1. prepare and send the request to the API middleware (i.e. the corresponding API methods)
2. save (and modify if necessary) the response and manage the state associated with it

Your [JSON Placeholder Free Fake API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) will consist of a single composable called `useTodos`. It's going to ship with:

- a `search` method calling our `searchTodos` API method under the hood
- a `todos` computed property
- a `loading` computed property
- an `error` computed property

In `integrations/jsonplaceholder/src` create a `/composables` directory with a `/useTodos` directory nested in it. In `/useTodos`, create two files:

```jsx
// integrations/jsonplaceholder/src/composables/useTodos/index.js

import { Logger, useVSFContext } from '@vue-storefront/core';
import { sharedRef } from '@vue-storefront/core';
import { computed } from '@nuxtjs/composition-api';
import useTodosMethods from './useTodosMethods';

const useTodos = (id) => {
  const context = useVSFContext();
  const todos = sharedRef([], `useTodos-todos-${id}`);
  const loading = sharedRef(false, `useTodos-loading-${id}`);
  const error = sharedRef({ search: null }, `useTodos-error-${id}`);

  /**
   * Searches for todos with given params
   */
  const search = async (params) => {
    Logger.debug(`useTodos/${id}/search`, params);

    try {
      loading.value = true;
      todos.value = await useTodosMethods.search(context, params);
      error.value.search = null;
    } catch (error) {
      error.value.search = error;
      Logger.error(`useTodos/${id}/search`, err);
    } finally {
      loading.value = false;
    }
  };

  return {
    search,
    todos: computed(() => todos.value),
    loading: computed(() => loading.value),
    error: computed(() => error.value),
  };
};

export default useTodos;
```

```jsx
// integrations/jsonplaceholder/src/composables/useTodos/useTodosMethods.js

const useTodosMethods = {
  search: async (context, params) => {
    return await context.$jsonplaceholder.api.searchTodos(params);
  },
};

export default useTodosMethods;
```

Even though you could easily do away with a single index.js file, itâ€™s a good practice to have two separate ones here:

- `index.js` - manages the composable's state
- `useTodosMethods.js` - stores the logic of the composable's methods (i.e. `search`).

Separating these will come in handy especially when dealing with composables featuring more than a single method and with more complex logic.

Now you can import the newly-created composable in your Vue components:

```vue
// pages/Home.vue
<template>
  <ul v-if="!loadingTodos && !todosError.search">
    <li v-for="todo in todos" :key="todo.id">
      <span>Title: {{ todo.title }}</span>
      <input type="checkbox" :checked="todo.completed" />
    </li>
  </ul>
</template>

<script>
import { onSSR } from '@vue-storefront/core';
import useTodos from '~/integrations/jsonplaceholder/src/composables/useTodos';

export default {
  setup() {
    const id = 1;
    const {
      todos,
      loading: loadingTodos,
      error: todosError,
      search: searchTodos,
    } = useTodos(id);

    onSSR(async () => {
      await searchTodos({ id });
    });

    return {
      todos,
      loadingTodos,
      todosError,
    };
  },
};
</script>
```

Congratulations! You've just created your first integration. Do not hesitate to show it to the Vue Storefront team to receive valuable feedback.
