# File Upload

The SDK supports file uploads using `multipart/form-data` requests. This guide explains how to implement file uploads in your application using TypeScript.

## Usage with Middleware

## Basic Usage

To upload files using the SDK, you need to:

1. Prepare your file(s) as `File` or `Blob` objects
2. Configure the request with the correct content type
3. Call your upload endpoint using the SDK

Here's a basic example:

```typescript
const file = new File(["content"], "test.txt", { type: "text/plain" });

const response = await sdk.commerce.uploadFile(
  { file },
  prepareConfig({
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "multipart/form-data",
    },
  })
);
```

## Multiple Files Upload

The SDK supports uploading multiple files in a single request:

```typescript
const files = [
  new File(["content1"], "file1.txt", { type: "text/plain" }),
  new File(["content2"], "file2.txt", { type: "text/plain" }),
];

const response = await sdk.commerce.uploadFile(
  { files },
  prepareConfig({
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "multipart/form-data",
    },
  })
);
```

## Additional Parameters

The SDK allows you to send additional parameters along with your files. This is useful when you need to include metadata or other information with your upload:

```typescript
interface UploadParams {
  category: string;
  description: string;
  tags: string[];
}

const response = await sdk.commerce.uploadFile(
  {
    files, // Your file or files array
    metadata: {
      category: "products",
      description: "Product images batch upload",
      tags: ["products", "images"],
    },
    visibility: "public",
    expiresIn: "30d",
  },
  prepareConfig({
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "multipart/form-data",
    },
  })
);
```

The SDK will automatically handle both the file data and additional parameters in the request. Here are some common use cases:

```typescript
// Single file with metadata
const response = await sdk.commerce.uploadFile(
  {
    file,
    category: "avatars",
    userId: "user123",
  },
  prepareConfig({
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "multipart/form-data",
    },
  })
);

// Multiple files with shared parameters
const response = await sdk.commerce.uploadFile(
  {
    files: [file1, file2, file3],
    batchId: "batch123",
    processImmediately: true,
  },
  prepareConfig({
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "multipart/form-data",
    },
  })
);
```

::tip
All additional parameters will be automatically included in the multipart/form-data request. You can include any serializable data alongside your files.

## Important Notes

1. **Content Type**: Always set the `Content-Type` header to `multipart/form-data` for file uploads.

2. **File Objects**: The SDK automatically handles `File` and `Blob` objects in the request parameters.

3. **Request Configuration**: Use `prepareConfig()` to set the correct headers and method for your upload request.

4. **Error Handling**: Always implement proper error handling for upload operations as they can fail for various reasons (file size limits, network issues, etc.).
