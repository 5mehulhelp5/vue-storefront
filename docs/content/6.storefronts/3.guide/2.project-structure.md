# Project Structure

When you use a storefront, you are a given a monorepo that contains two applications:

1. **Server Middleware** - A Node.js application that handles communication with the different services you use
2. **Web Application** - A Next.js or Nuxt.js application that handles the UI of your storefront

You'll also start with a set of layouts, pages, and components 

Our storefronts and boilerplates come with a pre-defined project structure that is designed to help you get started quickly. While this project structure may have minor changes between each storefront, the general structure will remain the same.

## `apps/`

### `server/`

### `web/`
